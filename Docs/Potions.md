# Potions

## Potion mixing instructions:
Every potion needs a base and two reagents
(long term: An optional catalyst that strengthens or changes the potion)
The base can be water or oil. Water is cheap but oil has a +1 boost

## Potion effects:
Health: Restore health
Cure: Cure status
Fire: If target is frozen, thaws them Else lingering damage over time
Ice: Weakens attacks
Lightning: Paralyzes for one turn
Poison: Weakens defence

## How is potion effect determined?
Each reagent has two possile effects. Potion effect is determined by the number of matching effects:
No matches: Unstable potion. Can be thrown for explosive damage. No experience granted.
1 match: That effect. Potion strength determined by sum of strengths of individual ingredients
2 matches: Inactive potion. Cannot be used. Spell slot *may* be unusable for the day

## Vials
Vials act as spell slots for our vancian magic system. We might chose to forgoe experience/levels entirely, in favor of allowing the player to find vials across the world as a way to strengthen up. You have three different types of vials, each with different effects

* Cantrip Vials, once filled with a potion, can be used as many times as you want until you return to your potion mixing station. Cantrip Vials can only be used to hold inactive potions or potions whose strength is 2 (that is, two reagents with +1 to their common effect, only water as a base).
* Trick Vials, once filled, can be used only once before you return to a potion mixing station. They can hold potions of any strength, including unstable potions
* Blessed Vials are exactly like trick vials, except they add a bonus to potions (including unstable potions). In the future, only blessed vials and stronger can accept a catalyst.
